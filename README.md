# **Canadian Wages**

This project provides users a way to search for wages (low, median, and high) by occupation (NOC) for all Provinces and Territories. The API is supplied by the Government of Canada that documents how wages are updated annually based on a standard methodology developed in collaboration with Statistics Canada. Additionally, the data is updated as required to reflect any changes in the minimum wage of an occupation in each province and territory.
